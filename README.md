- Make architectural decisions based on the AWS-recommended architectural principles and best practices.
- Explore using AWS services to make your infrastructure scalable, reliable, and highly available.
- Use AWS managed services to enable greater flexibility and resiliency in an infrastructure.
- Make an AWS-based infrastructure more efficient in order to increase performance and reduce costs.
- Use the Well-Architected Framework to improve architectures with AWS solutions.

This material is used during [COMP 3215](https://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/comp3215). The goal for COMP 3215 course is
